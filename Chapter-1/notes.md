# All you need is lambda

- Functional programming is based on expressions that include variables or constant values, expressions combined with other expressions, and functions.

- Functions have a head and a body and are those expressions that can be applied to arguments and reduced, or evaluated, to a result.

- Variables may be bound in the function declaration, and every time a bound variable shows up in a function, it has the same value.

- All functions take one argument and return one result.

- Functions are a mapping of a set of inputs to a set of outputs. 

- Given the same input, they always return the same result.
