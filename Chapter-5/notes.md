# Types

- In Haskell, where typing is static, typechecking occurs at compile time. That means many errors will be caught before you try to execute, or run, your program.

- All functions in Haskell take one argument and return one result.

- Currying refers to the nesting of multiple functions, each accepting one argument and returning one result, to allow the illusion of multiple-parameter functions.

- A function is polymorphic when its type signature has variables that can represent more than one type.
