# Hello, Haskell

- The order of declarations in a source code ﬁle doesn’t matter because GHCi loads the entire ﬁle at once,  so it knows all the values that have been deﬁned.

- Remember module names are capitalized.

- Remember var names are not capitalized, use camelCase

- Indentation of Haskell code is signiﬁcant and can change the meaning of the code. Incorrect indentation of
code can also break your code. Reminder: use spaces, not tabs, to indent your source code.

- The ($) will allow everything to the right of it to be evaluated ﬁrst and can be used to delay function application.

- let introduces an expression, so it can be used wherever you can have an expression, but where is a declaration and is bound to a surrounding syntactic construct.

- A parameter, or formal parameter, represents a value that will be passed to the function when the function is called.

- An argument is an input value the function is applied to.
