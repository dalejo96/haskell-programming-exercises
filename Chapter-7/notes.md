# More functional patterns

- Functions are defined by the fact that they can be applied to an argument and return a result.

- Pattern matching is a way of matching values against patterns and, where appropriate, binding variables to successful matches.

- Try to order your patterns from most specific to least specific, particularly as it concerns the use of _ to unconditionally match any value.

- Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions which each take one argument and return one result.

- Higher-order functions are functions which themselves take functions as arguments or return functions as results.
