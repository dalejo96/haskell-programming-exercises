# Typeclasses

- Typeclass inheritance is when a typeclass has a superclass. This is a way of expressing that a typeclass requires another typeclass to be available for a given type before you can write an instance.

- IO is the type for values whose evaluation bears the possibility of causing side eﬀects, such as printing text, reading text input from the user, reading or writing ﬁles, or connecting to remote computers.
