# Strings

- String is a type alias, or type synonym, for a list of Char.

- We concatenate strings with (++) and concat.

- The where and let clauses in Haskell introduce local bindings or declarations for expressions that are not
visible at the top level.

- Concatenation is the joining together of sequences of values.
